Give each team member a piece of paper and 5 minutes to silently ponder the questions. \
In the meantime (or before the session) divide a flip chart in 7 columns headed with 'Genre', 'Theme', 'Twist', 'Ending', 'Expected?', 'Highlight', 'Recommend?'. \
When everyone has finished writing, fill out the flip chart while each participant reads out their notes. \

desc:      "Try this activity to help teams that are only ever saying nice things to each other and seem reluctant to raise \
concerns about each other. If they are always keeping the peace, they miss growth opportunities \
and issues may fester. Feedback Sandwich is a way to learn how to give and receive potentially critical feedback. It goes like this: \
<br><br> \
Team members sit in a circle and take turns receiving the feedback. The team member who's turn it is is not allowed to say \
anything until each person finishes their 3 points. Once finished, the person receiving the feedback can only say 'Thank You'. \
Each takes turns receiving the feedback until all team members have participated. \
<br><br> \
Several days before the retro, you send out the following information to team members so that they can prepare: <br> \
'Think about the below questions for each of your team mates and prepare an answer before the session: \
<ol> \
   <li>What is something you really admire/respect about this person or something you think they do really well in a professional capacity?</li> \
<li>What is something you think is a weakness for this person? (Perhaps something they don't do so well, need to work on etc.)</li> \
<li>What is something you feel this person shows promise in, but could perhaps work on a little more to truly shine at it?</li> \
</ol> \
These questions are quite open in that you can draw on both technical and soft skills for each team member. \
So it might be that you choose to highlight a specific technical strength/weakness, or you might comment on \
someone's professional conduct, approachability, teaching skills, communication skills, etc. \
<br><br> \
<b>Disclaimer</b>: This activity is not about being nasty, or mean. It's intended to help the team get to know each \
other better and to improve on how we work individually and as a group. \
The idea is not to cause offence, but rather to understand how your team sees you and perhaps take something \
away to work on. It is up to you what you take away from it, you are free to ignore people's suggestions if \
you do not agree with them. Please deliver your feedback kindly and remember to thank your team for their \
feedback about you.'",

                   Corinna wished for something like Retromat during her Scrummaster years.
    Eventually she just built it herself in the hope that it would be useful to others, too.
